## Getting Started

To get started with the course, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You will also need to install the required libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Git and GitHub

This course is designed to be followed using Git and GitHub. Each section of the course is a separate branch, and you can switch between branches to see the code for each section.

To get started, you will need to create a new repository on GitHub. Then, you can clone the repository to your local machine and push your changes to the remote repository.

### Git Workflow

1.  Create a new directory for your project.
2.  Initialize a Git repository in the new directory.
3.  Create a new branch for the first section of the course.
4.  Follow the instructions in the course materials to complete the section.
5.  Commit your changes to the local repository.
6.  Push the changes to the remote repository.
7.  Repeat for each section of the course.
