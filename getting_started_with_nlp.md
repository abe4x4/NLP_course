# Getting Started with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Welcome to the world of Natural Language Processing! This guide will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of NLP, key terminology, and how to apply these concepts to a real-world project.

## What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It's the technology behind voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, machine translation services like Google Translate, and spam filters in your email.

## Key Terminology

Here are some of the most common terms you'll encounter in NLP:

*   **Corpus (plural: Corpora):** A large and structured set of texts. In our case, this will be our dataset of text documents.
*   **Tokenization:** The process of breaking down a text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, characters, or subwords.
*   **Stop Words:** Common words (like "the", "a", "is") that are often removed from text during preprocessing because they don't carry much meaning.
*   **Stemming and Lemmatization:** Techniques used to reduce words to their root form. For example, "running", "ran", and "runs" would all be reduced to "run".
*   **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** The process of assigning a grammatical category (like noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a text.
*   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** A task that involves identifying and classifying named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, etc.
*   **Vectorization:** The process of converting text into numerical representations (vectors) that can be used by machine learning models.
*   **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):** A numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.

## Coding NLP with Python

Python is the most popular language for NLP due to its extensive libraries and frameworks. Here are some of the key libraries we'll be using:

*   **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** A comprehensive library for various NLP tasks like tokenization, stemming, and POS tagging.
*   **spaCy:** A modern and efficient library for NLP, known for its speed and accuracy.
*   **Scikit-learn:** A powerful machine learning library that provides tools for text preprocessing and model building.
*   **Gensim:** A library for topic modeling and document similarity analysis.
*   **TensorFlow and PyTorch:** Deep learning frameworks that are used for more advanced NLP tasks like building neural networks for text classification and machine translation.

## Real-Life Project: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

Throughout this course, we will be working on a real-life project: building a sentiment analysis model for movie reviews. This model will be able to classify a movie review as either positive or negative.

Here's a sneak peek of the steps we'll take:

1.  **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** We'll start by collecting a dataset of movie reviews and then clean and preprocess the text data.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** We'll convert the text data into numerical features that can be used by our machine learning model.
3.  **Model Building:** We'll train a machine learning model to classify the sentiment of the movie reviews.
4.  **Model Evaluation:** We'll evaluate the performance of our model and fine-tune it for better accuracy.
5.  **Deployment:** We'll deploy our model so that it can be used to predict the sentiment of new movie reviews.

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of NLP concepts and practical experience in building and deploying NLP models. Let's get started!
