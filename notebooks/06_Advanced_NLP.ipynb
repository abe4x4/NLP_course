    "Deep learning has revolutionized the field of NLP, enabling significant improvements in various tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. Unlike traditional machine learning models that rely on hand-crafted features, deep learning models can automatically learn features from raw text data.\n\nThis is achieved through the use of neural networks with multiple layers, which can learn increasingly abstract representations of the text. In the following sections, we will explore some of the most popular deep learning architectures for NLP."
